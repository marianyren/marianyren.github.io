<div><h1>If You Forget Me by Pablo Neruda</h1>
<h3>I want you to know <em>one thing.</em></h3></div>

<ul><strong>You know how this is:</strong>
<em><li>if I look</li>
<li>at the <strong>crystal </strong> moon, at the red branch</li>
<li>of the slow autumn at my window,</li>
<li>if I <strong>touch</strong></li>
<li>near the fire</li>
<li>the impalpable ash</li>
<li>or the wrinkled body of the log,</li>
<li><strong>everything </strong> carries me to you,</li>
<li>as if everything that exists,</li>
<li>aromas, <strong>light</strong>, metals,</li>
<li>were little boats</li>
<li>that sail</li>
<li>toward those isles of <strong>yours</strong> that wait for me.</em></ul>

<br>

<p><h4>Well, now</h4><br>
if little by little you stop loving me<br>
I shall stop loving you little by little.</p>

<h6><em>If suddenly
you forget me
do not look for me,
for I shall already have forgotten you.

If you think it long and mad,
the wind of banners
that passes through my life,
and you decide
to leave me at the shore
of the heart where I have roots,
remember
that on that day,
at that hour,
I shall lift my arms
and my roots will set off
to seek another land.

But
if each day,
each hour,
you feel that you are destined for me
with implacable sweetness,
if each day a flower
climbs up to your lips to seek me,
ah my love, ah my own,
in me all that fire is repeated,
in me nothing is extinguished or forgotten,
my love feeds on your love, beloved,
and as long as you live it will be in your arms
without leaving mine</em></h6>
