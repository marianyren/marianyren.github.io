                 <p>If You <strong>Forget </strong> Me by Pablo Neruda I <em>want</em> you to know one thing. <strong> You </strong> know how this is: if I <em>look</em> at the crystal <strong>moon, </strong> at the red <em>branch</em> of the slow <strong> autumn </strong> at my window, if I <em>touch near</em> the fire the impalpable ash or the <em>wrinkled</em> body of the log, everything carries me to <em>you,</em> as if everything <strong>that</strong> exists, aromas, <em>light</em>, metals, were little boats that sail toward those<strong>  isles</strong> of yours <em>that</em> wait for me. Well, <strong> now,</strong> if little <em>by</em> little <strong> you </strong>top loving me I shall stop <em>loving </em> you little by little. If <strong>suddenly</strong> you forget me do <em>not</em> look for me, for I shall already have <strong>forgotten</strong> you.</p>

        <footer> <p> If you <em>think</em> it long and mad, the wind of <strong> banners</strong> that passes <em>through</em> my life, and you  <strong> decide </strong> to leave me at <em>the</em> shore of <strong> the</strong> heart where I have roots, <em>remember</em> that on that day, at that <strong> hour</strong>, I shall lift my arms and my <em>roots</em> will set off to seek another <strong> land</strong> . But if each day, each hour, <em>you feel</em> that you are destined for me with <strong> implacable</strong> sweetness, if each day a <em>flower</em> climbs <strong> up</strong> to your <em>lips</em> to seek <strong> me</strong>, ah my love, ah my own, in <em>me all </em>that fire is repeated, in me <strong> nothing</strong> is extinguished or <em>forgotten</em>, my love feeds on your love, <strong> beloved</strong>, and as long as you <em>live</em> it will be in your arms without <strong> leaving</strong> mine</p>
