        			<p><h1>Our Story</h1>
        			 </br>Unlike anything in LA before, we were one of the first in the city to launch the third wave of coffee. A move towards hand-crafted artisanal espresso. We have dedicated a lot of our time to help LA drinkers discover what fine coffee can taste like, and earned numerous accolades by journalists and customers along the way for Best Tasting Coffee in Los Angeles.

					Caffe Luxxe has also set out to celebrate European caffe culture. We encourage you to sit and enjoy socializing with friends and family.  Our Caffe Luxxe philosophy is friendly and approachable, yet technically precise without the pretension that we are know-it-alls. Everyone is welcome in our home, and we respect that you come visit us by choice.

Our coffee is never pre-prepped, tick the box, ice blended, or super-sized. For the true connoisseur, we create delicious drinks which are classic and timeless, following a European sensibility for taste, size, and temperature.</p>
